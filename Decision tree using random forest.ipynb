    "We are trying to predict the popularity of ted talks video using some features that we have identified important (preprocessing done separately) such as duration, languages and speaker categories. Out metric to decide the popularity of ted talk video is the total number of views. Total views for a video is available from the published date.\n",
    "To compare views, normalization has to be done. Assumption is that total views follows an exponential distribution with expected mean = 15 days\n",
    "Hence, Recommendation is to record views over time ( eg. Views in first week, Views in first month)\n",
